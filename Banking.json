Some people go to banks in search of a safe place to keep their money. Others are seeking to borrow money to buy a house or a car, start a business, expand a farm, pay for college, or do other things that require borrowing money.\n\nWhere do banks get the money to lend? \nThey get it from people who open accounts.
